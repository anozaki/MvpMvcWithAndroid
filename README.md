MvpMvcWithAndroid
=================

Very Rough Mvp/Mvc example in Android.

Don't use this example and implement it in your code, you will have problems!
Specifically Android restarting your application and losing the state of the
Calculator.

This is a simple example so you can see how MVP and MVC differ when I 
implement the same application in 2 different frame work.
